    What is machine learning?
        Algorithms that can learn from observational data, and can make predictions based on it.
    
    Different types of machine learning:
        1- Unsupervised Learning
            Not given any answers to learn from it and it must make sense of the data just given the observations
            You are looking for latent variables so unsupervised learning can tease out them
            By clustering users based on their information and behavior, unsupervised learning can tease out groups that don't conform your predisposed stereotypes.
                
        2- Supervised Learning
            The algorithm learns from data with the correct answers. The model created is used to predict answer for new values.
            If you have enough training data, split them to a training set and test set. They must be selected randomly.
            Train / Test is not infallible.
            overfitting can still happen.
                
    K-fold cross validation against overfitting
        - split your data into K randomly-assigned segments
        - Reserve one segment as your test data
        - Train on each of the remaining K-1 segments and measure their perdormance against the test set
        - Take the average of the K-1 r-squared scores
