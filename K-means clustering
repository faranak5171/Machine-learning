    K-means clustering:
        an unsupervised learning techniques
        Attempts to split data into K groups that are closest to K centroids.
        its algorithm:
            1- Randomly pick K ccentroids(k-means)
            2- Assign each data point to the centroid it's closet to
            3- Recompute the centroids based on the average positions of each centroid's points
            3- Iterate until points stop changing assignments to centroids
        If you want to predict the cluster for new points, just find the centroid they're closest to.
        
    K-means clustering Gotchas:
        - Choosing K
            start off low value, try increasing K values, until you stop getting large reduction in squared error
        - Avoid local minima
            The random choice of initial centroids can yield different results and get stuck in local minima instead of global clustering.
            Run it a few times just to make sure your initial results are not wacky
        - Labeling the clusters
            it's up to you to dig into the data and try to determine that
